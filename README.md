# Gradient Descent Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing **Gradient Descent** from scratch using Python. The goal is to demonstrate how gradient descent optimizes parameters in a machine learning model, especially for linear regression.

## 📄 Notebook File

- `gradient_descent.ipynb`: Core implementation of the gradient descent algorithm using Python and NumPy.

## 🚀 Features

- Manual implementation of gradient descent  
- Parameter optimization using cost minimization  
- Vectorized operations with NumPy  
- No external libraries used for model fitting (e.g., sklearn)  
- Standalone implementation without markdown descriptions  

## 🔧 Requirements

To run the notebook, install the following packages:
